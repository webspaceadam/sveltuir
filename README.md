With [Sveltuir](https://sveltuir.xyz) i wanted to create a tool that helps me memorize the fretboard of the guitar. It can be viewed as a gamification version of the tedious process of learning the fretboard. It is rudimental. But it does its job. 


## The Techstack
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

This is my first private public project built with svelte. I love the simplicity of the framework. In combination with Tailwind it is my go to choice for creating projects now.
